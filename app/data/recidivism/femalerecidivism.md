Over half of females serving time for a violent offense were arrested within
5 years of release from prison
WASHINGTON ― The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) is announcing the release of Recidivism of Females
Released from State Prison, 2012–2017. During the 5 years after their release in 2012, more than half of females
(55%, compared to 66% of males) who were serving time for a violent offense were arrested for another offense,
while more than a third (38%, compared to 49% of males) had a new conviction for any offense, and about a fourth
(27%, compared to 43% of males) were returned to prison.
“These findings illustrate the differences in the types of offenses that males and females were arrested for after
leaving prison,” said Dr. Alexis Piquero, Director of BJS.
About 7 in 10 (69%) females released in 2012 were serving time for a property or drug offense, compared to about 5
in 10 (52%) males. The percentage of females who returned to prison within 5 years was higher among those serving
time for a property offense (38%) than a violent offense (27%).
Overall, females (16%) were less likely than males (30%) to be arrested for a violent offense within 5 years of their
2012 release. Additionally, females (12%) were less likely than males (23%) to be arrested for assault. However,
females were more likely than males to be arrested for larceny (26% of females and 21% of males) and fraud or
forgery (12% of females and 9% of males).
“While the study found several differences in recidivism patterns by crime type, both males and females had a
median of four prior convictions in their criminal history,” noted Director Piquero.
These findings are based on BJS’s recidivism study on persons released from state prison across 34 states in 2012. It
compares females and males by their commitment offenses and recidivism patterns during the 5 years following
release. For more findings from the study, see BJS’s previous report, Recidivism of Prisoners Released in 34 States
in 2012: A 5-Year Follow-Up Period (2012–2017) (NCJ 255947, BJS, July 2021).
