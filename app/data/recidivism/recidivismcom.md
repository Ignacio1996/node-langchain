There have been two significant studies on recidivism in recent times: the first published by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in April 2014, tracking 400,000 inmates released in 2005 for five years until 2010; and the second published by the United States Sentencing Commission in March 2016, tracking 25,431 inmates released in 2005 for eight years until 2013.

The conventional wisdom is that over two-thirds of released inmates are re-arrested (though not necessarily re-convicted or -re-incarcerated) within a five year period of release. However, a contrarian view has been presented by William Rhodes and others, arguing that the data sample in those two prior studies overly represented repeat offenders that had accumulated in prisons, and that in fact 2 out of 3 inmates released never re-offend and only 11 percent re-offend more than once.

The causes cited for relapse into criminal behavior include both:

a failure of prisoners to successfully reenter due to:
drug addictions
lack of job skills
low educational levels
poor interpersonal skills, self-regard and mental habits
lack of financial resources on the date of their release
unchangeable characteristics of the offenderâ€™s environment outside of prison
poor family support system
poverty and resulting scarcity of available jobs
long-time connections to former associates such as gang members
stigma of being an ex-con and resulting difficulty getting a job or housing
Overall, rates of recidivism have been going up, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics:
